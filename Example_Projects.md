Example 01: Blinling LED
=========================

**->Introduction**

In this example you are learning how to turn on and off a LED or any other actuator which can be controlled by a digital output such as relay, bulb, motor.

**->Learning Outcomes**

From this example, you'll get an understanding about,

- Pin Mode

- Digital Write

- Delay Functions

**->Components**

- Magic Bit

**->Theory**

A digital output allows you to control a voltage with an electronic device. If the device instructs the output to be high, the output will produce a voltage (generally about 5 or 3.3 volts). If the device instructs the output to be low, it is connected to ground and produces no voltage.Here magicbit is the device and output voltage is either 3.3V for HIGH and 0V for LOW.

**->Methodology**

Magicbit equipped with four onboard leds in magicbit development board, Lets select red LED (which is wired to D27).
